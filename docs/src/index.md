# Overview

Welcome to the documentation of [`Actors`](https://github.com/JuliaActors/Actors.jl), a Julia library for concurrent computing with actors.

`Actors` implements the Actor Model of computation:

> An actor ... in response to a message it receives, can concurrently:
>
> - *send* a finite number of messages to other actors;
> - *create* a finite number of new actors;
> - designate the *behavior* to be used for the next message it receives. [^1]

`Actors` make(s) concurrency easy to understand and reason about and integrate(s) well with Julia's multi-threading and distributed computing. It provides a modern API [^2] for writing reactive [^3] applications, that are:

- *responsive*: react to inputs and events,
- *resilient*: can cope with failures,
- *elastic*: can distribute load over multiple threads and  workers,
- *message-driven*: rely on asynchronous message-passing.
